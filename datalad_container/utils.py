    """Helper to standardize container image path handling

    Previously, container configuration would contain platform-paths
    for container image location (e.g., windows paths when added on
    windows, POSIX paths elsewhere). This made cross-platform reuse
    impossible out-of-the box, but it also means that such dataset
    are out there in unknown numbers.

    This helper inspects an image path READ FROM CONFIG(!) and ensures
    that it matches platform conventions (because all other arguments)
    also come in platform conventions. This enables standardizing
    the storage conventions to be POSIX-only (for the future).

    Parameters
    ----------
    path: str
      A str-path, as read from the configuration, matching its conventions
      (relative path, pointing to a container image relative to the
      dataset's root).
    ds: Dataset
      This dataset's base path is used as a reference for resolving
      the relative image path to an absolute location on the file system.

    Returns
    -------

      Relative path in platform conventions
