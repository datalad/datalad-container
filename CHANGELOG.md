This is a high level and scarce summary of the changes between releases.  We
would recommend to consult log of the [DataLad git
repository](http://github.com/datalad/datalad-container) for more details.

## 0.1 (May 19, 2018) -- The Release

- Initial release with basic functionality to add, remove, and list
  containers in a dataset, plus a `run` command wrapper that injects
  the container image as an input dependency of a command call.
